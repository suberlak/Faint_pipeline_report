# Faint_pipeline_report
A repository describing all theory behind faint object pipeline employed in analysis of variability of [SDSS S82 dataset](https://github.com/suberlak/SDSS_S82_FP_research). It expands the work presented  as a [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByrJUkJHFrbdREZMMm5HS1BJV2s/view?usp=sharing) during  the 2016 (Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory Summer School)[http://scorpius.caltech.edu/ocs-2.3.6/index.php/iptf-ss/ssiptf-2016/schedConf/overview] organized in CalTech, Pasadena. 

Along with the [Variability Detection report](https://github.com/suberlak/Variability_report) this report is the second one in a  series of technical reports accompanying the main data-driven research document [SDSS_S82_paper](https://github.com/suberlak/SDSS_S82_paper).
